# List of Words:
# ==================================
# Argv | List Variable containing the Arguments passed to it for an associated Script.

# Complex | Variable type containing (J) Contains integer in the range 0 to 255.
# Comment | Way to block out a segment of Code to make the Compiler NOT execute the corresponding Text.
# DBES | Mnemonic for Decode Byes Encode Strings.
# Decode | Function decode() decodes the string using the codec registered for encoding.
# Def | Function used to create a user-defined function object.
# Encode | Function encode() encodes the string using the codec registered for encoding.
# Errors | 
# F-String | Literal String which contains expressions contained in braces.
# Float | Variable type containing (.) floating point real values.
# From | 1st Part of the import Statement; this Keyword allows the script to load various Libraries.
# Import | 2nd Part of the import Statement; this Keyword loads a specific Module from a given Library.
# Input | Function to store User provided textual input and store it into a Variable.
# Integer | Variable type containing a #.
# List | Variable type containing a series of values, enclosed with []'s; unlike Tuplies, Lists are mutable.
# Long | Variable type containing (L) Long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal.
# Open | Function to Open a given File Object so additional actions can be taken against the File Object.
# Print | Function that Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
# Print Format | Print Function allowing for Variables present value to be dynamically printed.
# Read | Function allowing a FileObject's contents to be Read and stored in memory.
# Repr | Return the canonical string representation of the object.
# Return | Function used to pass declared object values during the Exit of another Function.
# Sorted | Function returns a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.
# String | Variable type containing text.
# Strip | Function for Strings that removes characters from both left and right based upon the argument specified.
# Sys | This module provides access to objects and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
# Truncate | Function that deletes the contents of a given File Object.
# Tuple | Variable type containing a series of values, enclosed with ()'s; Tuples are fixed in size once assigned.
# Variable | Container for a type of value.
# Write | Function that Saves the Content/Data stored in Memory to a File Object.

# >= | Greater Than or Equal To: Used to Compare if value A is greater than or equal to B, if so, returns True, else False
# == | Equal: Used to Compare if two values are equal to one another, if so, returns True, otherwise False

# =======================================================================================
# ++ Study Drills ++
# =============================
# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
# 3. Annotate mistakes & avoid them in the future
# 4. Plus whatever the specific Lesson entails

# Mistakes
# =============================
# mistakes = {
# 	1st = Not remembering how to write an F-string
# 	2nd = Forgetting that Print Commands always end with the newline (\n) parameter unless otherwise specified
# 	3rd = Using repr to print out variables Example: print(">>>> object=", repr(object))
#	4th = Using Pydoc to read a command's description. Example: python -m pydoc <command>
#	5th = Trying to use Python via Powershell w/o 1st navigating to the Directory containing desired files
#	6th = Trying to print a fileObject before closing it
#	7th = Declaring Variables explicitly by Type
# }

# ++ Things to Remember ++
# =============================
# Function Checklist:
# =============================
# 1. Did you start your function definition with def?
# 2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
# 3. Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
# 4. Did you put your parameters after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
# 5. Did you make each parameter unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
# 6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the parameters?
# 7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.
# 8. Did you ”end” your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?
# 
# When you run (”use” or ”call”) a function, check these things:
# 1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
# 2. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
# 3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
# 4. Did you end the function call with a ) character?

# Use these two checklists on the remaining lessons until you do not need them anymore.
# Finally, repeat this a few times to yourself:
# 	”To ’run', ’call' or ’use’ a function all mean the same thing.”
