# declare the variable months, parse the string with '\n' for new line

# print a multiple line String using 3 double-quotes

There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.

# Study Drills
# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
# 3. Annotate mistakes & avoid them in the future
