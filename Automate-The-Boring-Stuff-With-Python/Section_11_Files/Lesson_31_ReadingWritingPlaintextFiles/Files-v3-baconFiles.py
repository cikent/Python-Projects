# The open() function will return a file object which has reading and writing –related methods.
# Pass ‘r' (or nothing) to open() to open the file in read mode. Pass ‘w' for write mode. Pass ‘a' for append mode.
# Opening a nonexistent filename in write or append mode will create that file.
# Call read() or write() to read the contents of a file or write a string to a file.
# Call readlines() to return a list of strings of the file's content.
# Call close() when you are done with the file.
# The shelve module can store Python values in a binary file.
# The shelve.open() function returns a dictionary-like shelf value.

# Import relevant modules
import os

# Create a File Object using the open() method using a Path value as the 1st argument, pass 'w' as the 2nd argument to Write to the file
baconFile = open('bacon.txt', 'w')

# Write to bacon.txt
baconFile.write('Bacon is not a vegtable!')

# Close the File Object
baconFile.close()

# Create a Debug Variable for os.getcwd(), to return the Current Working Directory
